# MyFirstApp

https://scrimba.com/p/pQxesM/

I followed this free tutorial partially to start on my first Angular-app and learn Angular by doing so.
I made some (hard coded) records with a search function, which fully works.
The Observables of this tutorial are outdated so I decided to stop there and only publish the list and search-function, nevertheless it was already a very interesting and exciting trip into Angular-land!

To see the app click on the following link:  https://annkemp.github.io/my-first-app/ or you can download it and test it out to find that it really works fine! :)

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 9.1.5.

## Development servert

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
